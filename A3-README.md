(Software Reliability and Testing course A3)

Please see my `A3-README.md` for my A3 instructions (uses A1 and A2, with replaced code as instructed by professor). Please also note that you may need to make the bash scripts executables again after unzipping.

## A3 Instructions

We wish to write tests to verify whether the following functionality is correct:

- do the lettergrades function correctly over their entire range?
  - for each of A+ through F work on their full range
- do the additions of grades use the lettergrade conversion functions properly?
  - do they call the lettergrade conversion functions the appropriate number of times and with the correct parameters?
- do the term objects get created and cleaned up properly?
  - are the right grades placed in the terms?
  - does term removal operate correctly?

## Test Case Design

- what the test case will verify
- whether mocks are used, and if so, how
- what supplied arguments will be provided, and to which functions
- what expected values will be observed
- (based on the results below) whether the test passes

## Test Cases

| Test Case Description | Mocks Used & How | Functions and Supplied Args | Expected Value(s) | Test Result |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| a | b | c | d | e |
